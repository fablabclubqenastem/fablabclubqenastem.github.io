With various functions such as weather predicting and fire detecting, the drone’s purposes justify the students’ intention to help Egypt overcome many environmental crises.
Remotely controlled, the students took advantage of great tools like a flutter programming language, mainly to send data from an Esp32 chip. With a high accuracy level, the drone’s sensors (DHT11 - HC-SR04 - KY-026) draw a negligible range of errors, making it the best life-saver in most situations.</description></item></channel></rss>
